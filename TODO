Project TODO

-------General--------
* Decide how lighting is coupled to in-game objects, or if lights should exist
  on a separate "layer"
* Create a timeline from now to release
* Decide roughly how many levels and what other features not listed here must be
added

---------Code---------
LIGHTING
* Clean up the lighting/rendering structure.  This will mostly require sitting
  down and thinking hard about /good/ program design (this is a priority)
* Implement dynamically loading lights from the level
* Give entities the ability to emit light (such as individual goo particles)

NEW FEATURES
* Add goo that sticks to walls (and emits light)
* Add support for background music for each level
* Add map screen that tracks where the player has explored
* Add support for level colour themes ?
* Add item inventory / goo stockpile
* Add save/load system for game progress
* Add options menu

---------Art----------
* Add individual walking/jumping animations for the sprites currently in the
  game
* Draw new tiles, items, and enemies as we think of them
* Design a logo (this requires that we think of a title first)
* Draw UI elements (generic buttons, checkboxes, popups)
* Either find a font that suits our game or make one

--------Audio---------
* Create background music for levels and menus
* Create sound effects for jumping, dying, enemies dashing
* Create sound effects for UI actions (clicking/hovering over buttons)

--------Levels--------
* Plan general areas and level themes
* Create a starting hub-world
* Create a level editor maybe

     Not actually 
-----  going to  -----
        happen
* Port everything to SDL and stick it to Oracle
* Rewrite all the bad code in the game
* Write some code now that there's nothing left
